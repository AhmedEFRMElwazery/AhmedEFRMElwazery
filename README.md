I am a Water Engineer 🌊 who developed a passion for software development 💻

I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python 😎  and currently learning Golang 👓

I am open to collaboration on software projects, but in particular to those pertaining to water 💧 agriculture 🌾 and the environment 🍀 and the cross-section between two or more of them.

I am currently developing my own software on those aforementioned themes as well.

💬 Feel free to reach out and ask me about anything that has to do with those abovementioned themes and skillsets. 

⚡ Fun fact: It might be of interest to know that I did my postgraduate studies @Wageningen University, and did some graduate level course @ ITC, University of Twente as well.
